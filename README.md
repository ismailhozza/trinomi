## Contacts

**Contacts** are the core feature of the app. Contacts can be **students**, **members**, **guardians**, **teachers**, etc. GenA stores only basic information from each contact most notably name, gender, year of birth, phone number, family size, address, tags and notes. Only **name**, **gender** and **phone number** are required all other fields are optional.

## Tags

Tags offer a powerful and a simple way to categories and manage contacts. They can be anything that you might imagine. Some example tags might be: parent, teacher, kids, boys, girls, etc.

Tags are managed under the user profile and only user with administrator role can change/modify them.

## Groups

Groups are based on tags and they offer two features: **calendar** and **messaging** for group of related contacts. Calendar widget of the group is shown on the bottom of the group. Above calendar there is messages sent to this group. Calendar events can be one time or recurring events.

Group membership is based on tags, any contact that has any of the tags of the group will be part of that group.
